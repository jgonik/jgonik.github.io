      <h1>Julia Gonik</h1>
      <p class="about">Hi! I'm Julia, and I'm an undergraduate at MIT studying computer science and math with a focus on machine learning.</p>
      <p class="about">I'm particularly interested in reinforcement learning (RL) and its applications for building
        autonomous and intelligent agents, robots, and machines. I've also studied NLP, computer vision, and deep generative networks with
        applications in robotics and cybersecurity.
      </p>
      <p class="about">
        Currently, I'm doing research with MIT CSAIL's Distributed Robotics Lab under professor Daniela Rus and postdoc Igor Gilitschenski. I'm working on
        adapting the OpenAI Gym car racing environment in order to use RL for cooperative multi-car team racing. The ultimate goal is to study the 
        kinds of coordinated strategies that autonomous agents can learn independently. In addition to research, last semester I took classes in machine learning,
        algorithms, and Russian.
      </p>
      <p class="about">
        Outside of schoolwork, I'm the current head of logistics for HackMIT's Blueprint. I'm also the Vice President of Chapter Relations and Standards of Alpha Chi Omega at MIT.
      </p>
      <p class="about">
        In my free time, I enjoy weightlifting, swimming, hiking, reading, creating digital art, and bothering my cat Emerson.

        <h3>October 2019 - June 2020</h3>
        <p class="project-text">During my sophomore year at MIT, I was an undergraduate researcher with Professor Pulkit Agrawal of CSAIL. I worked on training a small robot to autonomously navigate using independently collected image data of its environment.</p>
